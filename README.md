# React-athon

## Movie Madness - a one day React app built in our week 8 hackathon at school of code. We chose the OMDB movie API to fetch from in a full stack React app. 

## Styled with Tailwind

Check out a live [version here](https://steady-cendol-128cfb.netlify.app/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Requirements
You need to create an .env file and add an API key from the OMDB site under the name REACT_APP_APIKEY

Once loaded just type in a movie, series or video game.
